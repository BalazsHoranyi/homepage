Hi there, my name is Balazs Horanyi. I'm a machine learning engineer with a focus on productionalizing ML systems, particularly in the natural language processing domain. Currently, I'm working on building a search system that you can trust. When I'm not solving complex technical problems, I enjoy spending my free time on my bike, exploring the outdoors and staying active. Thank you for stopping by, feel free to get in touch to learn more about me or to discuss your next project.
